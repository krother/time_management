## Benefits

The *activity log* or *time log* is a tool that helps you to:

* become aware how you use your time
* collect hard evidence on how you use time
* identify your high-performance hours
* identify time wasters
* start improving your time management

## How to do it

* create an empty table
* note every half hour what you have been doing
* repeat the process for 1-2 weeks
* evaluate the result (e.g. categorizing)

There are plenty of mobile apps and other tools that help you keep a time log. But in principle an empty sheet of paper does the job.
