Time Management
===============

This is a 101 collection of classic time management tools. It helps you
to become more productive or more relaxed (which in turn will make you
more productive).

I wrote everything here with the needs of PhD students and postdocs in
life science laboratories in mind. You may find it useful if you work in
a different field, although you may find the biologists’ humour hard to
understand.

I hope the time you spend reading this ebook will be time well spent ;-)
